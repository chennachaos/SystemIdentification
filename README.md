# SystemIdentification

Python and Octave scripts for the identification of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems using standard regression, SINDy and other methods.


The sensitivity of chaotic dynamical systems to the initial conditions is well established. This is popularly known in the forward problems in chaotic dynamics as `the butterfly effect`. But, for inverse problems, it is the sensitivity of these systems to the values of the coefficients that matters the most, even if we can accurately predict the form of the expressions. We need methods, tools and programming language that use and allow for higher accuracies and precision if we aim to make progress in the right direction in predicting chaotic dynamical systems.
